# ⚛️ Quantum-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (QE-IDS)

A **Streamlit-powered simulation and visualization framework** for exploring how **quantum technologies** can transform and enhance Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in cybersecurity.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

As quantum computing advances, it introduces both **new attack vectors** and **powerful detection capabilities**.  
The **Quantum-Enhanced IDS (QE-IDS)** simulates how quantum computing concepts — such as **quantum feature encoding**, **quantum machine learning (QML)**, and **post-quantum cryptography** — can strengthen or challenge classical IDS systems.

Built with **Streamlit**, this simulator provides an interactive environment to:

- Generate and monitor **network traffic** (normal vs malicious)
- Visualize **quantum-enhanced detection metrics**
- Compare **classical vs quantum IDS performance**

It serves as an **educational and research tool** for understanding the next evolution of cyber defense.

## 🧩 Example Architecture

```python
class QuantumEnhancedIDS:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classical_model = load_classical_model()
        self.quantum_model = build_quantum_classifier()
    
    def analyze_packet(self, packet):
        classical_result = self.classical_model.predict(packet.features)
        quantum_result = self.quantum_model.predict(packet.quantum_encoded)
        return self.fuse_results(classical_result, quantum_result)
```

The app visualizes the **fusion results**, showing how quantum inference can improve accuracy or detection speed under specific conditions.
